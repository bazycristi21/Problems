1. Domino tiling

The input is an array of Domino pieces that have 2 numbers on them.
The rule is that a piece cand be placed after another piece if the second number on the first piece is equal with the first number on the second piece.
The pieces can not be rotated
The task is to get the maximal substring of domino pieces and how many maximal substrings are possible.



2. Road of maximum sum

The input is a matrix with integers.
The task is to get the road which has the maximum sum beginning from the first column and ends on the last one. The rule is that from an element you can only go right, right-up or right-down on the next column.



3. The square with the maximum dimension.

The input is a matrix filled with 0 and 1.
The first task is to get the maximum dimension square of 0.
The second task is to see how many squares bigger than k (input given) there are.



4. Palindrome partitioning

The input is a string.
The task is to get the palindrom partitioning (the minimum number of palindromes that concatenated give the original string)
